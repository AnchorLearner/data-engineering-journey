# Data Engineering Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my self-directed learning in data engineering â€” from core concepts to hands-on pipeline building using modern tools.

## ðŸ§­ Roadmap

| Week | Focus                     | Topics                                 |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | SQL Foundations           | SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY          |
| 2    | Python for ETL            | pandas, CSVs, basic transformations    |
| 3    | Orchestration with Airflow| DAGs, tasks, scheduling                |
| 4    | Spark Basics              | PySpark, RDDs, DataFrames              |
| 5    | AWS & Cloud Pipelines     | S3, Glue, Athena, Redshift             |
| 6+   | Capstone Project          | End-to-end data pipeline project       |

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

- `01-sql`: SQL practice queries and sample datasets
- `02-python-etl`: Python scripts for data extraction, transformation, and loading
- `03-airflow`: Airflow DAGs and scheduling examples
- `04-spark`: Spark experiments with PySpark
- `05-aws`: AWS workflows, CLI commands, and Glue jobs
- `notes`: Learning reflections, summaries, and to-dos

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Understand data pipelines end-to-end
- Build hands-on projects with real tools
- Document everything to retain and share knowledge
